#About
ReactNativeMovies is mobile app developed using React Native that used me as learning React Native app. While developign it I loved a concept of pocket movies browser so I continued with developing other features such as storing favorite movies to persistent storage.

All movies and data are downloaded using [TMDB.org API](http://api.themoviedb.org).
